    "## ✅ Roadmap del Proyecto de Web Scraping y Carga a Base de Datos\n",
    "\n",
    "Este proyecto tiene como objetivo scrapear libros desde una web pública, obtener información adicional mediante una API externa y almacenar los datos en una base de datos relacional para su posterior análisis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🛠️ Etapas del desarrollo\n",
    "\n",
    "- [ ] **1. Web Scraping**\n",
    "  - [x] Scrapear todos los géneros desde la página principal.\n",
    "  - [x] Iterar sobre cada género para obtener todos los libros listados.\n",
    "  - [ ] Extraer título, precio, stock, rating y link a la página del libro.\n",
    "  - [ ] Extraer información detallada desde la página de cada libro (si es necesario).\n",
    "  - [ ] Consultar la API de Google Books para obtener el autor y más detalles (usando el título).\n",
    "  - [ ] Guardar los datos obtenidos en archivos `.csv` separados:\n",
    "    - [ ] Libros (`libros.csv`)\n",
    "    - [ ] Autores (`autores.csv`)\n",
    "    - [ ] Géneros (`generos.csv`)\n",

    "  - [ ] Crear script DDL:\n",
    "    - [ ] Crear la base de datos (si no existe).\n",
    "    - [ ] Crear las tablas `libros`, `autores`, `generos`, y tablas intermedias para relaciones N:N si aplica.\n",
    "  - [ ] Crear diagrama UML/ER para visualizar relaciones.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [ ] **4. Inserción de Datos**\n",
    "  - [ ] Crear script DML para insertar los datos desde los CSV a la base de datos (usando Python + `psycopg2` o `SQLAlchemy` para PostgreSQL).\n",
    "  - [ ] Comprobar inserciones correctas mediante queries de prueba.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [ ] **5. Consultas y Análisis**\n",
    "  - [ ] Escribir consultas SQL para:\n",
    "    - [ ] Obtener todos los libros por género.\n",
    "    - [ ] Buscar libros por autor.\n",
    "    - [ ] Calcular estadísticas como precio promedio por género o autor.\n",
    "  - [ ] (Opcional) Crear una vista para simplificar reportes.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

For millennia this massif in eastern Turkey has been rumored as the resting place of Noah’s Ark following the Great Flood. But it also plays a significant role in the longstanding conflict between Turkey and Armenia.Author Rick Antonson joined a five-member expedition to the mountain’s nearly 17,000-foot summit, trekking alongside a contingent of Armenians, for whom Mount Ararat is the stolen symbol of their country. Antonson weaves vivid historical anecdote with unexpected travel vignettes, whether tracing earlier mountaineering attempts on the peak, recounting the genocide of Armenians and its unresolved debate, or depicting the Kurds’ ambitions for their own nation’s borders, which some say should include Mount Ararat.What unfolds in Full Moon Over Noah’s Ark is one man’s odyssey, a tale told through many stories. Starting with the flooding of the Black Sea in 5600 BCE, through to the Epic of Gilgamesh and the contrasting narratives of the Great Flood known to followers of the Judaic, Christian and Islamic religions, Full Moon Over Noah’s Ark takes readers along with Antonson through the shadows and broad landscapes of Turkey, Iraq, Iran and Armenia, shedding light on a troubled but fascinating area of the world. ...more\n",
